Getting to know GitHub

Hmm, what to write? What to write?

Oh I know!!!

This is Manish. I love Python. And Oracle PL/SQL. And SQL. And PostgreSQL.

I enjoy everything about Software Design and Development in general. I love building up ideas, drawing them out (I use Visio or Gliphy or plain old paper or whiteboards), debating the pros-and-cons of various approaches, reaching team agreement, and use that template to drive development.

I love seeing my ideas come to fruition.

And nothing more I love than seeing other people use stuff I've built and appreciate it.

So there!!!
